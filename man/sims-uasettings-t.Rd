\title{Simulation study results (unimodal, t-distributed)}
\description{
Results for simulations used in Korthauer and Kimes et al. (2019)
with 'unimodal' series of effect size distributions (Stephens, 2017)
with \eqn{t_{11}} distributed test statistics, and `cubic' informative
and paired uninformative covariates stored
as a list of SummarizedBenchmark objects from 100 replications.
In each simulation, 10\% of tests were non-null, i.e. had non-zero effect sizes.
Simulations were performed with `bimodal', `flat top', `skew' and `spiky'
effect size distributions (see corresponding reference for details).

In \code{\link{sims-uasettings}} and \code{\link{sims-uasettings-25}},
similar settings were considered, but with standard Gaussian distributed test statistics
and 25\% of tests being non-null, respectively.
}
\details{
The object is a list of length 100 corresponding to the 100 replications. Each
entry in the list is a named list of two SummarizedBenchmark objects. The results
based on using an informative and uninformative covariate are stored as
\code{"informative"} and \code{"uninformative"}, respectively.
